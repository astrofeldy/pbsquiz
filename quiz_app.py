personality_matches = {
    "Green Dot": """**"The overthinker in a spiral, but still making jokes."**

Loves a bit of heartbreak with a slice of chaotic romance. You‚Äôre smart, self-aware, and deeply committed to bad decisions ‚Äî but with taste. You flirt via existential memes and keep a well-thumbed copy of something sad in your tote bag.""",

    "The Work": """**"Emotionally sincere but academically intense."**

Probably falling in love with someone at a gallery opening or during a philosophical argument. You drink long blacks and think capitalism should be more ethical (but hotter). Your red flags are well-curated and you think about them during pilates.""",

    "Disorientation": """**"The burnout academic with a meme folder and a grudge."**

You‚Äôve been in a department meeting that became a class war. You survive by deploying humour, calling out nonsense, and getting a little unhinged in the group chat. You use footnotes *and* chaos to make a point.""",

    "The True Deceiver": """**"Mysterious girl autumn."**

You‚Äôve been described as ‚Äòquietly intimidating.‚Äô You bake sourdough as a power move. You trust no one, love sparingly, and probably live near a forest (or wish you did).""",

    "The Darkness Outside Us": """**"The queer disaster astronaut with too many feelings."**

You're trapped in a space mission *and* your own emotional growth arc. You want to scream ‚Äúwhat is happening??‚Äù ‚Äî but only after making out with your nemesis. You believe in love, even if it‚Äôs encrypted.""",

    "Interior Chinatown": """**"Satirical, stylish, and silently keeping score."**

You see the system. You‚Äôve memorized the script. And now? You‚Äôre flipping the narrative. You hold contradictions like a pro and weaponise awkward silence for justice.""",

    "Harriet Tubman: Live in Concert": """**"The history nerd who slays."**

You love a mash-up of revolution, glitter, and liberation. You‚Äôre here for Black excellence, queer joy, and the audacity to reimagine the past with power and play. Time travel is real and it‚Äôs called drag.""",

    "Crying in H Mart": """**"Tender soul with a memory for smells."**

You hold grief in one hand and a spoon in the other. You feel things hard, love deeply, and know that recipes are rituals. You‚Äôve cried in public and made it poetic.""",

    "Greta and Valdin": """**"Chaos with charisma."**

You're juggling dating apps, family group chats, and a too-intense crush, all with stunning outfits and solid jokes. Your mess is lovable, and you know it. People fall in love with you at brunch.""",

    "Unmasking Autism": """**"Self-aware, boundary-setting, and done with masking."**

You're learning how to exist in a world that doesn't always get it ‚Äî and doing it with clarity, courage, and maybe a new spreadsheet system for your special interests. You‚Äôre tired of pretending, and that‚Äôs your power.""",

    "The Book of Elsewhere": """**"Ancient soul in a modern timeline."**

You‚Äôve lived a thousand lives, each with a sword and a tragic backstory. You‚Äôre not afraid of darkness ‚Äî you *are* the darkness. You‚Äôre collecting scars like souvenirs and still look great in leather.""",

    "Ask Helen about Fanfic": """**"Queer-coded, deeply online, and suspiciously emotionally literate."**

You read character studies like scripture, love a redemption arc, and are somehow both trash and art. You‚Äôve never finished a fic without analyzing it. Also you have *takes*."""
